  <h2>Short Biography</h2>
<p>Born in Santiago de Chile. Rodrigo lived in Krakow with his family when he was a kid, due to his father's job as a contemporary music composer appointed to compose a symphony and to study at the Akademia Muzyczna under the tutelage of Prof. Marek Choloniewski. <br><br>Motivated by this excellent experience abroad, Rodrigo applied and was awarded the only Monbukagakusho scholarship for Chile to undertake his Bachelor's studies in Japan, graduating from Law with a major in International Relations from the University of Hokkaido, Japan. Subsequently, he won another scholarship to study his master's degree in International Relations at the University of Melbourne in Australia. After having lived in Japan and Australia for almost 10 years, he decided to return to Kraków, the city that had originally inspired him to see the world, in order to develop a research project that combines his expertise in International Relations (focused on Asian Studies) and Sustainability through the ACP (Agroecological Cultural Precincts).
<br><br>

	<p>Thanks to his artistic background coming from his father, mother and grandparents, all artists, Rodrigo could easily develop a passion for Arts at an early age, and never left it. He undertook formal Musical education for 11 years, obtained a diploma on Cinema and have been actively engaged with cultural and Art-related activities both as a hobby and professionally. <br><br>A believer in education through Arts, Rodrigo has developed his own methods that combine Arts and creativity to promote learning. He specialized with diplomas in Didactic Teaching Methods, and in Pedagogy for Higher Education from the Universidad Católica del Norte and Universidad Santo Tomás, respectively. For more than 10 years, he has worked as a university lecturer, language tutor, and translator in Chile, Japan and Poland. Fluent in Japanese and English, he is also able to speak Polish and Portuguese.
